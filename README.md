## Project Summaries

### `Algorithms`
Comparative analysis of four search mechanismsâ€”Binary Search, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Balanced Search Tree, and Bloom Filterâ€”executed in a controlled environment. Includes raw result logs and a discussion of time/space trade-offs.

---

### `MLDS`
An introductory machine-learning study that trains predictive models using **LASSO** and **RIDGE** regression. Jupyter notebooks walk through data wrangling, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

---

### `Principles-of-Programming`
C implementation of a maze-solving algorithm that demonstrates recursion, stack management, and efficient path-finding on grid graphs.

---

### `Computer-Graphics`
C++ code that showcases three rendering techniques:

1. **Ray Tracing** â€“ photo-realistic reflections and refractions.  
2. **Rasterization** â€“ real-time triangle pipeline.  
3. **Path Tracing** â€“ global illumination with Monte Carlo sampling.

Build scripts target modern OpenGL/GLFW.

---

### `Connect4Tool`
A classroom-friendly Connect 4 variant: before dropping a piece, each player must correctly answer a randomly generated mathematics problem, reinforcing skills while keeping gameplay engaging.

---

### `ExtendedEssay`
15-page research paper comparing **Fast R-CNN** and **YOLO** object-detection networks for autonomous-vehicle perception systems. Evaluates accuracy, inference latency, and resource footprint on standard datasets.
